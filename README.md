# Ash-Obj-Examples

Ash-Obj-Examples is an [Ash](https://github.com/ash-shell/ash) module used to illustrate usage of [Obj](https://github.com/ash-shell/obj), which is an Ash core module that adds object support to Bash.

# Getting started

You're going to have to install [Ash](https://github.com/ash-shell/ash) to use this module, as it is tightly coupled to the Ash core.

After you have Ash installed, run either one of these two commands depending on your git clone preference:

- `ash self:install git@github.com:BrandonRomano/ash-obj-examples.git`
- `ash self:install https://github.com/BrandonRomano/ash-obj-examples.git`

You can optionally add `--global` to the end of these commands to install them globally.

After that, you should now be good to use Ash-Obj-Examples.

Your best bet will be to run `ash obj_ex:help` to get a breif description of all of the examples, and go from there.  Dig into the source, and run/tweak the code until you're ready to start using objects in your own modules!
